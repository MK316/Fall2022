**Course Overview**  

This course introduces python, which enables us to handle natural language, to conduct statistics, to visualize data results. This is a basic course of python for English education major students.

**Big data:**  
Most of the time, big data is stored in a text format. Thus, getting an idea or tools to access to big data has become one of the favoured qualification requirements in various fields including academia. For instance, businesses using big data effectively can have a competitive advantage over those who don't because they are able to make faster and necessary decisions based on information. Big data also provides valuable insights into languages that researchers can use to refine their hypotheses in order to test or validatae linguistic patterns. Both historical and real-time data can be analyzed to assess the evolving patterns of langauge usage, enabling researchers to become more responsive to complicated phenomena observed or unobserved.

**Python and R:**
These are open-source programming languages that can effectively handle text data whether they are structured(e.g., excel files), semi-structured(e.g., certain language transcripts/records), or unstructured(e.g., writings/texts).
