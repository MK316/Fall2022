# Assignment 02 (Due by 10/17)

1. Review the session and save the file on your github repository.
2. Create two functions:

A. Multiplication x, y (the result should say: "__ multiplied by ___ results in ____."
B. Create concat(x,y,z), where x and y are simple clauses and concat creates a sentence to concatenate the two clauses using 'that'

z = "the earth is flat."
e.g., x = "I think", y="Mary said",

result: concat(x,y,z) => "I thought that Mary said that the earth is flat."
result: concat(y,x,z) => "Mary said that I thought that the earth is flat."
